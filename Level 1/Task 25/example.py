# =========== Welcome to Your Final Task! ===========
# This task will consolidate the knowledge that you've gained across various tasks.
# Now that you know basic Python, we can start talking about some interesting topics!
# Remember take advantage of google and the Python documents in order to get more information. These are a programmer's greatest tool.


# =========== What is Bioinformatics? ===========
# Bioinformatics is a type of science which deals with methods for storing, retrieving and analysing biological data.
# This includes DNA and protein sequences, structures, functions, pathways and genetic interfaces.
# Bioinformatics also deals with algorithms, databases and information systems, web technologies, artificial intelligence and soft computing.
# It also uses information and computation theory, structural biology, software engineering, data mining, image processing and modelling and simulation.
# Finally, bioinformatics makes use of signal processing, discrete mathematics, control and system theory, circuit theory and statistics.


# =========== Sequence Alignment ===========
# In this task we will focus on using Python to solve a problem known as sequence alignment.
# Sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity
# that may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.


# =========== DNA and Nucleotides ===========
# DNA is a chemical structure found in almost every cell and contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms
# DNA is just a String. Yes, just like in programming; DNA is a long chemical string-like structure.
# A portion of DNA can be broken down into sub particles called nucleotides.
# Nucleotides are smaller molecules that when joined up form the complete String of DNA.

# There are only 4 different types of nucleotides in DNA:
#   Adenine which is just represented by an A .
#   Cytosine which is just represented by a C .
#   Guanine which is just represented by a G .
#   Thymine which is just represented by a T .


# ************ Example 1 ************
# An example of a DNA sequence would be:

DNA = "ACGTAGTA"

# Every codon (3 nucleotides) of DNA can be specified by one Amino Acid. 

print("The DNA sequence 'ACG' is a codon")
print("The 'ACG' codon corresponds to the Amino Acid Threonine ")
print("But it's so tedious using a table to look up every Amino Acid. Let's write a quick program to do it for us")
