In the data for 2008, the mean Birth Rate decreased whereas the Life Expectancy increased, suggesting an inversely proportional
relationship between the two values. Afghanistan, for instance, remained in the same cluster despite having a massive increase in
Life Expectancy from 1953 to 2008.

(2008)South Africa and (1953)United States share a cluster, United States has slightly higher values for both Birth Rate and Life Expectancy.

Countries which showed very little improvement in their data values from 1953 to 2008 are more likely to be in clusters populated by a majority
of 1953 values, whereas certain first-world countries who had significant boosts to their values are located in seperate clusters with more 2008
countries.
